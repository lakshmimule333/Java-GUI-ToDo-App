Java-GUI-ToDo-App

NAME : MULE LAKSHMI NARAYANAMMA

Project Description
This project is a To-Do List Application built using Java Swing. It allows users to create and manage daily tasks with a simple desktop GUI. The application demonstrates the use of core Swing components such as JFrame, JButton, JTextField, JList, JScrollPane, and JPanel, along with event handling for user interactions.

The project was developed as part of the Java Developer Internship program to strengthen skills in GUI programming, event-driven design, and layout management.
